## 1. Executive Summary

The FlowRun Streamlet: IoC Triage is an AI-powered security operations tool that automates the investigation of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). Built on LangGraph and LangChain with vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry observability, the agent compresses a 10–25 minute manual analyst workflow into a sub-30-second automated pipeline while producing a full audit trail of every decision made.

## 2. Problem Statement & Goals

**2.1 Problem Statement**

Security Operations Centers face a structural imbalance between alert volume and analyst capacity. A mid-sized enterprise generates thousands of security alerts per day. Each alert that contains an IOC requires a manual multi-source investigation before an analyst can make a triage decision.

> **Core Problem Statement**
> Security teams are drowning in IOCs that take too long to investigate manually. Existing automation lacks the transparency needed to trust, audit, and improve triage decisions.

**2.2 Goals**

| **ID**   | **Goal**                                                                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **G-01** | Reduce per-IOC triage time from 10–25 minutes to under 30 seconds                      |
| **G-02** | Aggregate intelligence from 4+ sources in a single, standardized workflow              |
| **G-03** | Produce a deterministic, explainable severity verdict for every IOC                    |
| **G-04** | Generate a complete, traceable audit trail for every triage decision via OpenTelemetry  |
| **G-05** | Deliver a Jupyter Notebook interface suitable for demos, training, and experimentation |
| **G-06** | Ensure zero hardcoded credentials — all keys managed via secure runtime injection      |
| **G-07** | Detect malicious software packages across 27 ecosystems via OSV.dev                   |

**2.3 Non-Goals (v0.0.32)**

- No REST API or web UI — CLI and Jupyter only
- No SIEM integration (Splunk, Sentinel, etc.) — planned for v2.0
- No automated remediation (blocking IPs, revoking certs, etc.)
- No bulk IOC ingestion from CSV or file upload

## 6. Architecture & Technical Design

**6.1 System Layers**

| **Layer**               | **Description**                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interaction Layer**   | CLI (interactive terminal) + Jupyter Notebook (ipywidgets). Accepts raw IOC input, displays reports.                         |
| **Agent Orchestration** | LangGraph StateGraph with typed AgentState. Manages node execution, conditional routing.                                     |
| **LLM Integration**     | LangChain + OpenAI. GPT-4o-mini (temperature=0.0) for classification. GPT-4o (temperature=0.3) for report synthesis. Both configured in agent/llm.py MODEL_CONFIG. |
| **Tool / API Layer**    | LangChain Tool-wrapped async httpx clients for VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, OTX, urlscan.io, NIST NVD, OSV.dev, and npm/PyPI registries. |
| **Observability Layer** | Traceloop SDK (OpenLLMetry) auto-instrumentation. OTLP/HTTP exporter streaming spans to the configured collector (default: local agent on http://localhost:4318). |

**6.2 LangGraph Node Definitions**

| **Node Name**        | **Responsibility**                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **input_node**       | Receives raw IOC string, runs regex pre-classification, initializes AgentState                                                                                      |
| **classifier_node**  | GPT-4o-mini: detects IOC type if regex was inconclusive. Routes to enrichment or error.                                                                            |
| **enrichment_node**  | asyncio.gather(): fires all applicable tool coroutines concurrently. For URL types, also queries domain-level VT + OTX. For package_multi, scans 10 ecosystems.    |
| **correlation_node** | Pure Python: reads raw_intel, applies weighted scoring via compute_composite(raw_intel, intel_errors, ioc_type), detects conflicting signals                        |
| **severity_node**    | Maps composite_score to severity_band (CLEAN/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), writes verdict_justification                                                               |
| **report_node**      | GPT-4o synthesises correlation summary. Formats CLI text + HTML report with TL;DR, detection names, conflict callouts.                                              |
| **escalation_gate**  | If severity_band == CRITICAL: CLI mode → input() prompt; Jupyter mode → auto-proceeds with warning.                                                                |
| **error_node**       | Handles unrecognised IOC types with clear error message.                                                                                                           |

**6.3 AgentState Schema**

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    ioc_raw: str                        # Original user input
    ioc_clean: str                      # Normalised value

    raw_intel: dict[str, Any]           # {source_name: parsed_response_dict}
    intel_errors: list[str]             # Non-fatal errors
    score_breakdown: dict[str, float]   # Per-source normalised 0.0–1.0 scores
    composite_score: float              # Weighted aggregate
    active_weights: dict[str, float]    # Re-normalised if sources unavailable
    severity_band: str                  # CLEAN|LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL
    verdict_justification: str          # Plain-English explanation
    escalation_required: bool           # True only when CRITICAL
    report_text: str                    # CLI-formatted report
    report_html: str                    # HTML-formatted report for Jupyter
    trace_endpoint: str                 # OTLP endpoint where this run's spans were exported
```

|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.00 – 0.10    | 🟢 CLEAN    | No credible threat signals                                   |
| 0.11 – 0.30    | 🟡 LOW      | Minor or stale signals — monitor                             |
| 0.31 – 0.55    | 🟠 MEDIUM   | Credible signals — investigate and consider blocking         |
| 0.56 – 0.75    | 🔴 HIGH     | Strong signals — block and escalate                          |
| 0.76 – 1.00    | 🚨 CRITICAL | Confirmed malicious — block immediately, trigger IR playbook |

## 8. Observability Design (OpenTelemetry)

**8.1 Trace Structure**

Each agent run produces a single root trace with spans mirroring the LangGraph execution graph. Auto-instrumented by Traceloop SDK (OpenLLMetry) + manual custom spans for correlation and severity nodes emitted via the standard `opentelemetry.trace.get_tracer()` API. All spans are exported via OTLP/HTTP to the configured collector (default: local agent on `http://localhost:4318`).

**8.2 Required Span Attributes**

| **Span Name**         | **Required Attributes**                                                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **flowrun.triage**    | ioc.type, ioc.value, severity.band, composite.score, run.duration_ms                  |
| **flowrun.classify**  | llm.model, llm.prompt_tokens, llm.completion_tokens, ioc.detected_type                |
| **tool.\***           | tool.name, tool.input, tool.output_raw, tool.latency_ms, tool.status                  |
| **flowrun.correlate** | score.{source}, composite.score, weights.active                                       |
| **flowrun.severity**  | severity.band, verdict.justification, escalation.required                              |


## 9. Credential Management

| **Variable Name**      | **Required?** | **Where to Obtain**                 |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| **OPENAI_API_KEY**     | Required      | platform.openai.com → API Keys      |
| **VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY** | Required      | virustotal.com → Profile → API Key  |
| **ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY**  | Required      | abuseipdb.com → Account → API       |
| **OTX_API_KEY**        | Required      | otx.alienvault.com → Settings       |
| **URLSCAN_API_KEY**    | Required      | urlscan.io → Settings → API Keys    |

Note: OSV.dev, npm registry, and PyPI JSON API require no API keys.

Resolution order: (1) .env file → (2) os.environ → (3) interactive getpass(). Keys never logged, printed, or included in OpenTelemetry span attributes.

**Optional OpenTelemetry configuration** (not enforced — defaults work out of the box):

| **Variable Name**              | **Purpose**                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT**| OTLP/HTTP endpoint for span export. Default `http://localhost:4318`.                              |
| **TRACELOOP_BASE_URL**         | Traceloop-style alias for the above (used if the OTEL var is unset).                              |
| **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS** | Comma-separated `key=value` pairs for authenticated collectors (e.g. `Authorization=Bearer ...`). |
| **OTEL_SERVICE_NAME**          | Override the `service.name` resource attribute. Default `flowrun-streamlet-ioc-triage`.           |

| **AC-10** | End-to-End Latency             | Full triage completes in under 30 seconds                                                                                         |
| **AC-11** | Malicious Package              | npm package with MAL- advisory returns CRITICAL                                                                                   |
| **AC-12** | Clean Package                  | Established npm package with no advisories returns CLEAN/LOW                                                                      |

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

| **ID**   | **Severity** | **Risk**                                            | **Mitigation**                                                                              |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **R-01** | HIGH         | Free API rate limits exhausted during demo          | Use known-safe test IOCs. Cache results for demo runs.                                      |
| **R-02** | MEDIUM       | VirusTotal key flagged for excessive use            | Implement request throttling. Non-linear VT normaliser reduces need for multiple queries.   |
| **R-03** | MEDIUM       | OTLP export fails silently when collector unreachable | Wrap in try/except; log to stderr but never block triage (NFR-07).                         |
| **R-04** | LOW          | GPT-4o-mini misclassifies IOC type                  | Regex pre-classification resolves 9 of 10 IOC types before LLM is called.                  |
| **R-05** | LOW          | urlscan.io public scans expose IOC                  | Documented: use private scan API for sensitive IOCs.                                        |

| **v2.0**   | REST API             | FastAPI wrapper for programmatic IOC submission                                    |
| **v2.0**   | SIEM Integration     | Cribl, Elastic, and Splunk connectors                                                     |
| **v2.0**   | Bulk IOC Ingestion   | CSV file upload for batch triage                                                   |
| **v2.1**   | Trace-driven Evals   | OTel-based span/trace-level LLM-as-judge evaluations                              |
| **v2.1**   | Socket.dev           | Real-time supply chain attack detection (install script analysis, network behavior)|
| **v3.0**   | Multi-Agent SOC      | Supervisor + sub-agent architecture                                                |
